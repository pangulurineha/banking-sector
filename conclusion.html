  <p>
    As part of our Community Service Project on "Ideas for Safety in the Banking Sector," we conducted a survey in Narukuru village, gathering responses from 50 people. Our goal was to collect suggestions from the public on how to prevent banking frauds and online scams while also spreading awareness among those who were unfamiliar with these risks.
  </p>
  <p>
    Through this survey, we identified key concerns regarding banking security and learned that many people lack awareness about cyber threats, phishing scams, and fraudulent transactions. To address this, we took the initiative to educate them about safe banking practices, such as using strong passwords, avoiding suspicious links, and verifying transaction details before making payments.
  </p>
  <p>
    By implementing the suggestions gathered and promoting digital literacy, we can help create a safer banking environment for rural communities. Our efforts in raising awareness will contribute to reducing fraud cases and ensuring that people are more cautious while handling financial transactions. This project has reinforced the importance of collaborative efforts between banks, authorities, and the public in building a secure and fraud-free banking system.
